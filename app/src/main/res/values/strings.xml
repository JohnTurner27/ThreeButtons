    <string name="text1">A random paragraph can also be an excellent way for a writer to tackle writers block. Writing block can often happen due to being stuck with a current project that the writer is trying to complete. By inserting a completely random paragraph from which to begin, it can take down some of the issues that may have been causing the writers block in the first place.</string>
    <string name="text2">Another productive way to use this tool to begin a daily writing routine. One way is to generate a random paragraph with the intention to try to rewrite it while still keeping the original meaning. The purpose here is to just get the writing started so that when the writer goes onto their days writing projects, words are already flowing from their fingers.</string>
    <string name="text3">Another writing challenge can be to take the individual sentences in the random paragraph and incorporate a single sentence from that into a new paragraph to create a short story. Unlike the random sentence generator, the sentences from the random paragraph will have some connection to one another so it will be a bit different. You also wont know exactly how many sentences will appear in the random paragraph.</string>
